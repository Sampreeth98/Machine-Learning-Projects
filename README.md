# Machine Learning Projects

## Overview
Welcome to the Machine Learning Projects repository! This repository contains code and documentation for various machine learning projects. Our primary focus is on predictive modeling and data analysis tasks.

## Project Description
One of the projects included in this repository entails predicting fraudulent merchants from a problematic dataset. Comprehensive data engineering, cleaning, and processing are conducted to refine the dataset. Utilizing logistic regression, the model aims to discern fraudulent activities, showcasing the significance of robust data preprocessing in fraud detection.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: This directory contains datasets used in the projects.
- **code/**: Contains the source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **documentation/**: Contains documentation related to the projects, including reports and technical specifications.
- **results/**: Contains the output or results generated from data processing and analysis.
